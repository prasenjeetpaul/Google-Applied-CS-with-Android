# Introduction

This app is a single-user word game called WordStack. 
The idea of the game is to try to separate out two words of the same length whose letters have been scrambled (but the order of the letters has been preserved).

**Objective:** By the end of this app development:
*	You will feel comfortable implementing and make use of a stack.
* You will be able to make use of some built-in Android functions.

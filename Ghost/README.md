# Introduction

This repository consists a game called Ghost.<br>
Ghost is a word game in which players take turns adding individual letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word.


**Objective:** By the end of this app development, you will:
*	Implement a word game called Ghost.
*	Complete the SimpleDictionary implementation. (The game comes with two dictionary classes: SimpleDictionary, which is a partial implementation; and FastDictionary which you will implement in the next unit.)

# Introduction

In this repo, we will create a game from scratch in Android Studio. <br>The game that we will be creating is a dice game called Scarne's dice
Scarneâ€™s Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling a die.
<br>**The rules for the game are:**
1. **If they roll 1:**
    <br>Scores no points and lose their turn
2. **If they roll 2 to 6:**
    <br>Add the rolled value to their points
    <br>Choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn

The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.

#In this workshop, we will create a game from scratch in Android Studio. The game that we will be creating is a dice game called Scarne's dice.

Scarneâ€™s Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling a die and then:

    if they roll a 1, score no points and lose their turn
    if they roll a 2 to 6:
        add the rolled value to their points
        choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn

The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.
